just completed my first Business Intelligence project!

I’m really excited to share that I’ve successfully finished my first BI project titled “Coffee Shop Sales Analysis.”
Breaking into the field of Business Intelligence has been both challenging and rewarding, and this project marks a big milestone in my learning journey.

About the project:
The goal was to analyze coffee shop sales data to uncover patterns and insights that can help improve business performance. I explored questions like:
Which products generate the most revenue?
What are the busiest days and hours?
How do customer buying trends change over time?

Tools I used:
SQL for data cleaning and exploration
Power BI for building interactive dashboards

 What I learned:
This project helped me understand how to turn raw data into meaningful insights that can support better decision-making — a core skill in BI. It also boosted my confidence in using SQL and Power BI together for storytelling through data.
I’m proud of this first step and excited to keep learning, building, and growing in the world of Business Intelligence!
